## UNCALLED: a Utility for Nanopore Current ALgnment to Large Expanses of DNA

### Real-time targeted sequencing

Uncalled enables targeted sequencing by directly aligning raw nanopore signal to a reference and selectively ejecting reads via [adaptive sampling](https://nanoporetech.com/resource-centre/adaptive-sampling-oxford-nanopore) (AKA ReadUntil).

## Uncalled4: visualization and analysis of nanopore RNA and DNA signal alignments

We are actively developing our next major release titled Uncalled4: a toolkit for alignment, analysis, and visualization of raw nanopore RNA and DNA signal. Uncalled4 features interactive alignment visualizations, an alignment algorithm guided by Guppy metadata, methods for comparing Tombo and Nanopolish alignments, and epigenetic modification detection statistics. This will eventually be merged into the main codebase, but in the meantime a development version can be found on the [uncalled4 branch](https://github.com/skovaka/UNCALLED/tree/uncalled4).
