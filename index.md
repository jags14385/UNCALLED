## UNCALLED: a Utility for Nanopore Current ALgnment to Large Expanses of DNA

### Real-time targeted sequencing

Uncalled enables targeted sequencing by directly aligning raw nanopore signal to a reference and selectively ejecting reads via [adaptive sampling](https://nanoporetech.com/resource-centre/adaptive-sampling-oxford-nanopore) (AKA ReadUntil). We also provide a simulator which can be used to predict what level of enrichment could be achieved on a given reference using raw signal data from previous nanopore runs. For documentation and more information see the [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/skovaka/UNCALLED), or read the paper below:

### Coming soon: Uncalled4

We are actively developing our next major release titled Uncalled4: a toolkit for nanopore signal alignment, analysis, and visualization for raw nanopore DNA and RNA signal. A poorly documented development version of Uncalled4 is currently availible on [the "drna" branch](https://github.com/skovaka/UNCALLED/tree/drna).
